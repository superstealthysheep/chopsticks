# Welcome!

In this folder you'll find a few example graphs for various versions of Chopsticks. Below are links to view the graphs:

- **[2,2,2 game](https://google.com). This one is very small so it's good to try first to see if your device can display the graphs.** This is a 2 player game of chopsticks, where each player has 2 hands, and each hand only has two fingers. (If you get two on a hand, that hand dies.) 
- [3,2,2 game](https://google.com). This is a 3 player game of chopsticks where each hand has two fingers. You can already see how much more complex stuff becomes just by adding one player!
- **[2,2,5 game](https://google.com), the classic one.** 2 players, 2 hands per player, 5 fingers per hand. Note: this graph is very large and may be quite laggy.

Now, a quick explanation of the color code:
- Green marks the start.
- Blue is for player 0, red is for player 1, and orange is for player 2.
	- <u>Dark blue</u> means a gamestate where player 0 has won.
	- <u>Medium blue</u> means a gamestate where player 0 will inevitably win.
	- <u>Light blue</u> means a gamestate where player 0 is guaranteed a win *if they play the right moves*.
	- The same logic applies for the other colors.

Finally, if you scroll down on these pages, you can see the physics settings. These control the physics simulation running on the graphs. You can disable physics to basically eliminate all lag. Apart from that, feel free to play around with the settings!
